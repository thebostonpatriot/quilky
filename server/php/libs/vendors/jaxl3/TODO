- http_bind.php example is broken as in JAXLLoop doesn't terminates with HTTP request termination

- move http pkt parsing logic to http_server from http_request
  this should do a better fix for multi-part form parsing, websocket upgrades in future etc etc

- create separate repo for /core, /xmpp + /xep, /http

- more tests, full test suits, ci and built reports on github
